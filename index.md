I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Blender Lab</a> of <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">UIUC</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html" target="_blank">Prof. Heng Ji</a>. My research interests are in natural language processing, knowledge reasoning, and computation for the social good.

I did two internships at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. I always look for exciting opportunities!
