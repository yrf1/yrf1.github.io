I studied <b>Ph.D.</b> at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"><b>University of Illinois</b></a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Heng Ji</b></a>. My research focus centers around <b>socially-situated human-centered trustworthy NLP/AI</b> with <b>multimedia knowledge reasoning</b> capability and <b>scalable alignment</b> principles. My work on fundamental model architectural mechanisms and frameworks empowering <b><i>harmless</i></b>, <b><i>helpful</i></b>, and <i><b>honest</b></i> information communication has been recognized by <b>three best/oustanding paper awards</b> at <b>top AI/NLP conferences</b>.
