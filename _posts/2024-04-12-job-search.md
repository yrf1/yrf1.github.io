This is just my personal take based on what I've heard from my peer circle. Thought to share it so others may benefit, but also a mini disclaimer upfront to take with a grain of salt and utilize your best discretion.

## Letter of Recommendation
For many North American universities, the interfolio web app is used as a tool for letter upload. I utilized the unique identifier option so that professors don't have to submit a letter for every new school, as I thought it saves hassle. But some professors start raising concerns and don't think letters will be trickling in proactively \& successfully into places applied. There's no easy way to check. So next time, just input the actual email address instead of Interfolio user identifier ID if your letter writers don't complain -- that's really the safer option.

## The Do's \& Dont's of Small Talk during Interview Visit
<B>Do's:</B>
<B>Computing power and server availability</B>; really shows you are planning for the long-term, you know what you're doing in leading a lab, and you're interested in growing a successful career at the university. I've known candidates who got rejected because they only discussed social aspects in small talks.

<B>Dont's</B>
I've known some female peers who discussed about <B>maternity leave</B> options during offer discussion etc., and later regretted it because the reality of life is that it's more or less a sensitive topic in terms placing best foot forward in the professional field. I mean, it can be super important; but the maternity leave package will stay unchanged so it can be deprioritized into sth that can fished out much later in minor conversations after one has taken on the job.

## Be Prepared for Medical Symptom Emergencies for these Back-to-Back Length Campus Visit Interview Trips
During my series of interview trips, I suddently got really sick at some point from medical condition. I couldn't sleep all night, couldn't eat anything, had to in-take medical-grade glucose gels, and I had a interview the next day, when I had no offer on-hand yet at the time. I really wanted to reschedule the interview, but in the end I figured the interview chance would likely be gone if I request last minute reschedule. The story I learned here is to prep a series of emergency medical pills in our luggage to handle various situations like this. 

## What Was Personally Most Touching for Me
Still with medical pills, I was really sick and couldn't sleep at all till ~6am in the morning. The most touching moment was when I on-called my close friend in seek of some comfort and/or emotion support, and he told me relax while starting to play me a guitar song. I finally fell asleep from that, and at some point, I woke again and realized I was still on the call and my friend was still playing guitar for me. I was like: "omg I'm so sorry that I fell sleep... [blah blah blah]". ü•πü•π

Anyways, in the future, if you're in my friend circle, and you really need emergency support, I am there. ü§ùü§ù
