Sharing some of my life experience and thoughts. Might be insightful, or helpful if it resonates with you.

<br>
At ICCV 2017, we realized that [GANs were growing strong]({{ site.url }}/gans-et-al-growing-strong/), and before we did a set [of]({{ site.url }}/dl-lstm-gan-evolution) [posts]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-scraping/) of [the]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-plateau/) [deep learning]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-takes-over-again/) [saga]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-evolution/).<br>
<br>
Let's update the plots to CVPR 2018, as always, using the XKCD style, as described in this [blog post]({{ site.url }}/xkcd-deep-learning/), but this time putting all trends together:
<br />

<br />
<br />

So, general deep-learning keywords are getting out of fashion (we take them for granted), but GANs are no longer such a minority (8\%!). LSTM, on the other hand, cannot keep up. Will GANs catch up with general deep learning?<br />
<br />
Are GANs the new Deep?
