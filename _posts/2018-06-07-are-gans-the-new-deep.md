Sharing some of my life experience and thoughts. Might be insightful, or helpful if it resonates with you.

<br>
I'll start with the difficulties I've went through.
* I came from a high school in which the people who studied computer science constitutes a very small population (<10). Upon graduating high school and entering college, I met my classmate's brother who studies CS and has related internships. I was excited to hear more about CS opportunities in college and beyond, but it turned out that he was very interested and took actions in which at that time I was uncomfortable and didn't know how to respond properly because I have never dated anyone before. The initial exposure to women interested in tech lead me to forgo CS as my major entering college, and I switched back into CS late regretting the opportunities I've missed.

Here's how I've learnt to deal with it over the years.

General thoughts? Work hard. Play hard. Don't be afraid, and live life to the fullest!
