Sharing some of my life experience and thoughts. Might be insightful, or helpful if it resonates with you.

<br>
I'll start with the difficulties I've went through.
* I came from a high school in which the people who studied computer science constitutes a very small population (<10). Upon graduating high school and entering college, I met my classmate's brother who studies CS and has related internships. I was excited to hear more about CS opportunities in college and beyond, but it turned out that he was very interested and took actions in which at that time I was uncomfortable and didn't know how to respond properly because I have never dated anyone before. The initial exposure to women interested in tech lead me to forgo CS as my major entering college, and I switched back into CS late regretting the opportunities I've missed.
* When I finally switched back into CS during my undergraduate years, I had trouble fitting - and fitting in with peers is an essential part for a successful college experience. I went to Rice University, which has a high population of upper middle class or international students (aka pretty rich). I wanted to join good study groups. But a lot of my fellow classmates were very trendy and fashionable, drink & party, like to eat out a lot and travel to distant places. I found that most people who I can relate to socioeconomically and culturally (in terms of money spending patterns) were struggling to do well in CS. The observation fell in line with the statistical correlation of people who do well in top colleges and people who come from a rich family. And falling into the other category, I experienced struggles that I feel like would not have happened if I attended a larger public university where I can find my suitable, supportive peer group.

Here's how I've learnt to deal with it over the years.

General thoughts? Work hard. Play hard. Don't be afraid, and live life to the fullest!
