When you are applying for a CS PhD, you can be taking an important step in your life. Here are some tips on applying so that you can place your best foot forward. 

<br>
I have had an unsuccessful round of PhD applications, but 1-2 years later I finally landed myself into UIUC and a top-choice lab. Comparing my experience, these are what I've done differently and what I think helped.
* **Start your Statement of Purpose early.** I finished brainstorming my statement of purpose in September, and writing it in October. As I was writing, I went through many rounds of edits - with myself, my boyfriend, the Campus Library Writing Center, and the CS Writing Faculty. I worked on my statement of purpose almost every day, for 2-6 hrs. Each day can shed a new light on how to frame the paper. And finally, November is the time to tweak that final paragraph towards the different schools I'm applying too and start submitting.  
* Position your Statement of Purpose wisely.
* Apply to many PhD programs
* Submit your application early
* Make sure your recommendation writers submit on time

Finally, many thanks to Rick Freedman, Sandeep Polisetty, Joie Yeahuay Wu, Deep Chakraborty, and many others for their help and support. Really appreciate it!
