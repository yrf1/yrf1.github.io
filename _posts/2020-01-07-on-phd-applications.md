When you are applying for a CS PhD, you can be taking an important step in your life. Here are some tips on applying so that you can place your best foot forward. 

<br>
I have had an unsuccessful round of PhD applications, but 1-2 years later I finally landed myself into UIUC and a top-choice lab. Comparing my experience, these are what I've done differently and what I think helped.
* **Start your Personal Statement early**
  Testing
* Position your Personal Statement wisely
* Apply to many PhD programs
* Submit your application early
* Make sure your recommendation writers submit on time
<br />

<br>
Finally, many thanks to Rick Freedman, Sandeep Polisetty, Joie Yeahuay Wu, Deep Chakraborty, and many others for their help and support. Really appreciate it!
